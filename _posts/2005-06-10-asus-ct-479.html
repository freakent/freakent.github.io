<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/products4.aspx?l1=3&#038;l2=54&#038;l3=0&#038;model=467&#038;modelmenu=1"><img src="http://www.asus.com/999%5Cimages%5Cproducts%5C467%5C467_m.jpg" alt="ASUS CT-479" class="alignright"/></a>Still on my quest to build an ultra quiet, lower power consuming server using a Pentium M chip, I have found this socket 478-to-479 converter from ASUS. It allows a standard ASUS motherboard to run a Pentium M chip.<br />

This has three big advantages over the Aopen board(s) :<br />
1)  I can choose a board most suited to my requirements (SATA RAID etc)<br />
2) The CT-479 can support either 533mhz or 400mhz FSB processors, given that I'll probably be buying my processor through eBay this will allow me to be a bit more flexible.<br />
3) Much cheaper ! From what I have seen, the Aopen Pentium M boards are twice the price of most motherboards.</p>
