<p><img src="http://flickr.com/images/flickr_logo_beta.gif" alt="Flickr" class="alignright"/>I have started using the online photo service <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> to share my photos with friends and family. It has some really nice features, like viewing security, excellent slide show in your browser and these cool Flickr badges (check out the Flickr Daily Zeitgeist in the sidebar) . The service is free if you can live with a 20MB per month upload limit, although you can pay $24.95 per year to increase this limit to 2GB per month (and they remove the adds from your pages). I'm using the free service. I wish the slide show images were a little larger and the UI could be a little less confusing to someone who hasn't seen it before, but all in all it's a great service.</p>
