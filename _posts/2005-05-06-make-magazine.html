<p><img alt="Make Magazine Home" class="alignright" src="http://www.makezine.com/images/logos/make_logo3.gif" /> I first heard about O'Reilly's new magazine through a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail168.html">podcast</a> on IT Conversations and from the former Engadget guy <a href="http://www.flashenabled.com/">Phil Torrone</a>. Apparently this is O'Reilly's first magazine publication. It's all about geeky techy projects and it's full of ideas for things you can build.<br />

I looked up the <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make Magazine web site</a> and found you could order a subscription to the mag but it was all in the US and I thought it could end up getting complicated. On another visit to their site I noticed that you could also buy a copy from Amazon.com, I checked on Amazon.co.uk and sure enough they had it too, only &pound;6.96 plus shipping (at least it is in &pound;'s).</p>
<p>So what it's like. One word - complicated.  Well at least it is complicated for me ! There are two really interesting projects, hanging a camera from a kite to take aerial photos and a DIY mag strip reader. The kite project looks completely overkill but I might have a go at the mag strip reader, watch this space.</p>
<p>Overall, despite not necessarily wanting to do all the projects, it is a very good read and I will definitely order the next issue.</p>
