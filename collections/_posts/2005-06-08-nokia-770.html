<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/770"><img src="http://www.mobilegazette.com/images/nokia/nokia-770-3.jpg" alt="Nokia 770" class="alignright" width="200"/></a>Nokia have launched yet another really interesting device, the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/770">Nokia 770</a>. They describe this device as an "Internet Tablet" because it doesn't actually include a phone! For connectivity it just supports WiFi and Bluetooth. For me, the most surprising fact about this device is that it runs Linux.  Considering they describe it as a tablet I was surprised how small it is. I was expecting something around the size of a table PC but instead it looks just a bit bigger than a phone and more like a PDA. It is due to ship around autumn this year.<br />
