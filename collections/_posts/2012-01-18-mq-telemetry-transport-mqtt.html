  content: Glad the interview caught your interest :-) there are plenty of different
    implementations around now - and lots of folks using MQTT in their home projects
    with e.g. Arduino, mbed, Nanode and Netduino! Do join the mailing list and check
    out mqtt.org/get-involved :-)

  content: Thanks for the pointers to get involved. I have requested membership to
    the Google group.

<p><a href="mqtt.org"><img class="alignright" title="MQTT" src="http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mqttorg-glow.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>The whole Internet-of-things idea has really captured my imagination. DIY Sensors and Machine-2-machine computing are becoming a reality thanks to open source projects like Arduino.</p>
<p>Today I stumbled upon a <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5153.html">podcast interview</a> on <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQ Telemetry Transport, or MQTT</a>, with Andy Piper from IBM. MQTT is an M2M/Internet of things connectivity protocol developed at IBM. Much of the podcast talks about how this technology is being used in home DIY sensor projects. MQTT is based on a "Publish and Subscribe" architecture and requires a Broker to handle the messaging. Although IBM have a few different MQTT Broker implementations, there is an open source implementation of the broker server called <a href="http://mqtt.org/">Mosquitto&nbsp;</a> that looks worth experimenting with.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough to wet your appetite, Andy Stanford-Clark (also from IBM) gave a presentation called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/andysc/the-house-that-twitters">"The house that Twitters"</a> which explains how he has used MQTT to create a number of interesting home sensor projects.</p>
