<p>Well it may as well be with all the effort I've put into to getting something I actually like. I've spent a fair amount of time looking at other peoples 'blogs, searching the web and trying out different systems. I even considered building my own, but in this day and age that would be stupid.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The features I really wanted in order of importance :<br />
* Ability to integrate into my existing web site<br />
* Spell checker<br />
* Comments<br />
* Search<br />
* RSS</p>
<p>First I tried <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> :<br />
+ nice and simple UI,<br />
+ free hosted service,<br />
+ ability to publish via ftp to my own web site.<br />
+ included a spell checker<br />
- no reader commenting<br />
- no search<br />
- no RSS, just Atom</p>
<p>Next Nucleus :<br />
+ developed in PHP (cool) and MySQL<br />
+ very very customisable<br />
+ search and reader commenting<br />
+ loads and loads of plug-ins<br />
+ every flavour of RSS ever conceived<br />
- no spell checker<br />
- templates way too complicated<br />
- very very very slow (which I am sure is my ISPs fault)</p>
<p>Lastly <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> :<br />
+ developed in Perl and MySQL<br />
+ simple to customise<br />
+ search and comments<br />
+ simple to use<br />
+ very fast<br />
+ loads of plug ins<br />
- no spell checker</p>
<p>So which did I go for ? Movable Type scored only one negative - no spellcheckcer. Looks like you'll just have to put up with the ocasionl speling mistoke. It's really easy to use and I really like it, although I did have a few problems with the install. It didn't help that I accidentally ran the initial load script twice or that I put the wrong domain name in the config file - and I'm supposed to be a professional! Biggest problem I had was trying to log in first time. It just wouldn't accept the default system generated username and password. A couple of minutes on the excellent <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/support/">MT Forums </a>pointed to it being caused by cookies. I cleared my cookies in IE and then it worked first time. I haven't yet intergrated it with my site but that looks like it will be a doddle.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.rittman.net/">Mark Rittman</a> whose blog I have been reading and without whom I would not have discovered Movable Type.</p>
