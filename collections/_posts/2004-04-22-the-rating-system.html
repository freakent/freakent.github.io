<p>I have been drafting a couple of 'blog entries on a few new toys I have been playing with and decided there was something missing. No decent review would be complete without a rating system. My subjective waffle may be fine for me but without a clear, concise and quantative rating how can anybody see what's good and what's not ?<br />
<!--more--><br />
So here I unveil the Freak Gadget Rating or FGR as it will be now known. The FGR is made of 6 parts :</p>
<p><b>1. Features and Function</b><br />
Does it do everything you would expect it to ?  Are there any useful features you weren't expecting ?</p>
<p><b>2. Ease of use</b><br />
How well has it been designed ? Are the features you'd use most easy to understand and access ? Could the rest of my familiy use it ?</p>
<p><b>3. Looks and style</b><br />
Is it easy on the eye or will my wife give me grief and ban it from the house ?</p>
<p><b>4. Build quality</b><br />
Will it stand up to the demands of use for the next years ?</p>
<p><b>5. Value for money</b><br />
Does it's cost represent good value compared with its features and functions ?</p>
<p><b>6. Day to day impact</b><br />
This is the most important category - just how often would it get used and will it really have an affect on our day to day lives ?</p>
<p>Each category will be marked out of 10 and the total score expressed as a percentage. So bring on the gadgets and let's see how they score !</p>
