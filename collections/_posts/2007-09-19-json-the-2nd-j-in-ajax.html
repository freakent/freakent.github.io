<p><a href="http://www.json.org"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px;" src="http://www.json.org/img/json160.gif" border="0" alt="" width="125" height="125" align="right" /></a>I stumbled across this new web technology called JSON whilst reading about the performance features being introduced into by AJAX web development tool I use.  Essentially they replaced the XML interface between the server and browser based JavaScript client with JSON. JSON is a way of expressing complex data structures which is less verbose than XML and is supported natively by JavaScript which makes it much more performant in those environments.  The home of JSON on the web is <a href="http://www.json.org" target="_blank">www.json.org</a>, where there is an article called "<a href="http://www.json.org/fatfree.html" target="_blank">The Fat Free Alternative to XML</a>" that does an excellent job of explaining the benefits of JSON. There are also links to JSON libraries for just about every programming language that ever existed. So the question is, will the web community now have to change the name of Ajax ?</p>
