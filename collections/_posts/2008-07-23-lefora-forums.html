<p><a href="http://www.lefora.com"><img src="http://media.lefora.com/img/frontpage/0-lefora-free-forum-hosting.png" border="0" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>Thanks again to BBC Click I have discovered a great new service on the Internet. Lefora is a free forum service that lets you create a discussion forum service for your own communities. It's really easy to set up, customise and get started.</p>
<p>So why do I need a forum? Well I've been secretly working on my own little project and now it's time to start getting users on board. Using Lefora has enabled me to concentrate on my own service and not waste valuable time implementing another forum. You can check out my forum at <a href="http://rondayvoo.lefora.com">rondayvoo.lefora.com</a>.&nbsp; Oh yeah, my little project is at <a href="http://www.rondayvoo.com">Rondayvoo.com</a>. Feel free to check it out and use the forum to tell me what you think!</p>
<p>If you want your own free forum just click on :</p>
