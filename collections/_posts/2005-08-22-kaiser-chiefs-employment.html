It was recommended to me by the same friend who put me on to Kasabian, so without any hesitation I just ordered it from Amazon. I recognised the first track "Everyday I Love You Less and Less" immediately but the others took a few plays to grow on me. But now I'm totally into it. It's also the CD that my Son always asks for now when he gets in my car.</p>
