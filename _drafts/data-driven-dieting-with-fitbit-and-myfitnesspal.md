<p>Like many people at the start of the new year, I made a resolution to get a little fitter and loose a bit of weight. Obviously I couldn't do this without a bit of help from a gadget or two, so I arranged for Santa to leave two FitBits under our Christmas Tree; one for myself and one for my wife.</p>
<p>It's now the end of March and I'm very happy to announce I've lost 1 and a half stone (21lbs) since Christmas with the help of Fitbit and MyFitnessPal.</p>
<p>I'm no dietary expert but it seems obvious to me that the secret to loosing weight is to simply burn more calories than you consume. To do that, you need data. FitBit provides a good estimation of the calories I burn each day, but I found MyFitnessPal was better for calculating the calories I consumed. I thought I'd share how I use the two services together.<br />

<p>Fitbit One<br />
Fitbit make three different devices, I chose the Fitbit One. It's a small wireless device that you can clip on to your pocket. It connects to the Internet through either a small USB dongle you plug into your PC or through a recent Apple iOS device (one with Bluetooth 4, iPad 3 in my case). It has a variety of on-board sensors that it uses to calculate footsteps taken, floor climbs, calories burned, overall activity and sleep activity.</p>
<p>The data from my Fitbit is automatically sent to the Fitbit server where it is displayed on my own personal Fitbit Dashboard. The Dashboard uses a number of charts to clearly show all my data. To supplement the data collected by the sensor, the Dashboard enables you to enter other pieces information such as your weight, food eaten, activities and water consumed. It can then calculate your overall net calorie consumption per day and track your progress towards targets you can set for yourself. My goal is a simple one; to eat 500 calories per day less than I burn and get my BMI down to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>Fitbit also have an iPhone app that presents a mobile version of your Dashboard and let you enter the additional information. It's a shame there isn't an iPad optimised version to take advantage of the extra screen size.</p>
<p>There are also social and gaming aspects to Fitbit. The Fitbit dashboard will award you badges when you reach certain goals. So far I have been awarded the 10 floors and ??? badge. It's a small thing but every little bit of motivation helps. You can also add Fitbit friends to your profile and it will let you compare your progress and badges with your friends. My wife and I are regularly comparing how many steps per day we have each managed and trying to out do each other (she usually wins by the way).</p>
<p>The one weakness of Fitbit is that it's food database doesn't specifically support UK foods. You wouldn't think that US and UK foods are that different but many of the entries in the database refer to specific US food and restaurant brands. Fitbit has an active UK community forum so I asked them how they managed this food problem and they all pointed me to MyFitnessPal.com.</p>
<p>MyFitnessPal<br />
In many ways, MyFitnessPal is much like the Fitbit Dashboard. Not so pretty to look at, but very similar in functionality. Where they differ is that MyFitnessPal do not have their own sensor, instead they make it very easy to integrate their service with others that do. It was very easy to link my Fitbit and MyFitnessPal accounts so that both exchange my data. They also have a great database of UK foods so you can record quite accurately what you have eaten in each meal. All the meals I enter on MyFitnessPal automatically appear on the Fitbit Dashboard (albeit in summary form) and my Fitbit data appears on MyFitnessPal.</p>
<p>MyFitnessPal have very good mobile apps for iPhone and iPad. Both apps includes a barcode scanner so you can simply scan the packaging to record what you have eaten. Unlike Fitbit, the iPad app is optimised for iPad and makes full use of the the larger screen.</p>
<p>Since getting into Fitbit I've been surprised how many other similar wearable fitness devices are now available. After using Fitbit for a month I'd happily recommend Fitbit to anyone looking to loose a few pounds.</p>
