message: Chris, it should be straight forward to configure. I have Series 2 XBees
  so your setup may have to be different. The XBee node only has two configuration
  options, a name and the serial port. You can name it anything you like and the serial
  port is configured in exactly the same way as the serial port node (it actually
  uses the same code underneath). Easiest thing to do is to create a flow with just
  the XBee node and a debug node, connecting the Xbee output to the debug node.
