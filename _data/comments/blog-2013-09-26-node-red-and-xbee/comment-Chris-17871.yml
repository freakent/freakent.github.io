message: "Hi,\r\nI tested your method and it works! Thanks for this excellent post.
  I now can send messages from my Arduino to node-red using the XBee Series 2 in API
  Mode 2. But it left a few questions to me. I'm not a Javascript guy and tried quite
  some time to display the HEX values of the payload using the DEBUG node. It works
  (using a function node with toChar and toString(16), but only for values in the
  ASCII range. I tried the Binary Buffer feature of the serial connection as well,
  but with no luck.\r\nI guess, I don't understand the basic concepts of node-red.
  Is it suitable for binary data, and where is the direction to look or go?\r\nThe
  second question is about sending a status response, but this is for later.\r\nMany
  thanks for any ideas or help!\r\nChris"
