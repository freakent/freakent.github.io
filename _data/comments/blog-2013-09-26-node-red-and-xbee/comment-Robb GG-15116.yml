message: "I've been trying to use your plugin for a server to communicate with multiple
  xbee endpoints and I was wordering if you colud provide some help with getting it
  working. I have the node-red flow set up to return a timestamp when it's sent a
  message with \"Time Please\" as the payload and it should be sending a packet out
  with a UNIX timestamp in to the endpoint but it doesn't seem to be reaching it's
  destination and I'm not sure where to go from here. I've attached a serial sniffer
  and data is definately being sent to the xbee from node-red but it doesn't seem
  to be reaching the endpoint. \r\n\r\nIf you could offer any tips that would be much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n// Robb"
