message: "I originally got the serial nodes to read all the raw data coming in on
  my xbee series 1 radios, /dev/ttyO2:9600.  Now I've got this NR-XBee loaded but
  sadly I don't understand how it's to be configured.\r\n\r\nThe xbee nodes are available
  and I loaded the example flow.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to have a dozen remote xbee radios
  transmitting 4 ADCs each and occasionally, based on some condition, like LDR detects
  dark, send a signal back, like setting D4 to x04,to close relay to turn on lamp.\r\n\r\nUsing
  a Beaglebone Black, UART2, /dev/ttyO2, xbee series 1 coordinator in api2 mode.\r\n\r\nAny
  tips appreciated.  Thanks,\r\nChris."
