message: Robosapien seems to be back on his feet. Despite getting absolutely no response
  from Wow Wee (the makers of Robosapien), we managed to get his remote working again.
  My Dad just took the back of the handset, put it back together again and magically
  it now works.  Wow Wee's customer support is very very poor.
