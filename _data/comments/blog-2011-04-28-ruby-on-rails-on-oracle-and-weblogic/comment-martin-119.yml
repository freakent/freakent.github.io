message: Hi Jared, I can't be exactly sure which version of the Warbler gem I used,
  I have both 1.3.0 and 1.2.1 on my system.  I also have jruby-rack 1.0.8 and 1.0.7
  with jruby-1.6.0. I hope that is of some help. What errors are you getting in your
  log file? Is Weblogic even trying to start the Rails app?
