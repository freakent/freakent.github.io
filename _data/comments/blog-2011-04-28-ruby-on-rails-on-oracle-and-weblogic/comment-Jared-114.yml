message: "I don't suppose you know which version of Warbler you used here?  \r\n\r\nI
  cannot for the life of me get a rails app to boot up on my client's WebLogic.  Current
  warbler is 1.3.2 (containing jruby-core-1.6.6, jruby-rack-1.1.3)\r\n\r\nThe WebLogic
  my client has is 10.3.0.0 - I'm not sure if this version is an issue.  The WAR file
  does not include a rackup / config.ru file when building.  If I leave it out it
  doesn't boot up.  If I manually put it in, I get rack errors that it can't find
  any gem files.  \r\n\r\nI'd like to try a version of warbler you tried - if you
  know this I will compare the versions to see if something went wrong here.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks"
