message: "Thanks Martin.  I ended up finally booting up the Rails app in Weblogic.
  \ \r\n\r\nI used the following gem combo: \r\n- jruby-rack 1.0.2\r\n- jruby-jars
  1.5.1\r\n- warbler 1.2.1\r\n\r\nThe error was in Rack - I have a feeling the current
  Jruby rack was wrong:  as mentioned above the latest one really wanted a rackup
  file, which warbler didn't include by default.  And with it, I would then receive
  gem dependency errors.  Using the above combo of gems, it ran with default settings
  straight out of the box.  I'm attempting to push it to jruby 1.6 though!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJared"
