message: Johann, that's not how I am using the S2 XBee's. The receiving XBee (the
  coordinator) is being accessed through external software via the API. I think the
  S1 XBee's might support what you are expecting. If you monitor the receiver using
  the X-CTU software you should see data messages being received.
