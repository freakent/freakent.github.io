message: Martin, Please be so kind as to post me your complete and total setup for
  S2 Xbee as I also have some of them. If possible line for linefor X-CTU. I have
  been battling for the past week with this. I also find that for some obscure reason
  I can not talk to some of the units after a while. I am even trying to reset these
  units manually ie. Reset (Pin5) to Gnd. I am beginning to think that Xbee is not
  very reliable. I have used the above units in projects for some time. If you can
  help I will be very thankful. Johann
