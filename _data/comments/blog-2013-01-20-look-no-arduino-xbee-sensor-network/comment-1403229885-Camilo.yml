message: "hello \r\nI was looking for an example like this to xbee s2, but only found
  for s1, thanks. \r\nCan you do the same for an analog signal (without microcontroller)?
  Is enough to set analog input to enable DIO ? or should I make other changes? Is
  it true, that the analog input must not exceed 1.2V? Thank you."
