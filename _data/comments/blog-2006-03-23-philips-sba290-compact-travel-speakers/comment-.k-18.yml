  i just bought the same unit. the power adaptor is a dissapointment, but you can always get a spare one for us voltage, just note the output power of 9V/ 500mA, and also check the polarity.

  i wonder why the manual states "do not use rechargable batteries"?

  anyway, i bought 6 GP rech.batteris 1000mAh each, and after 6 hours, still playing at full volume.
