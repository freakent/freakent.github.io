  Hey Cous',
  I haven't heard of Earthcore or Ancestor.  Sounds like sci-fi reading to me.  I'll wait for the movie(s) and check them out.
  Thanks for your recent comments on my xanga.  I checked out the geocaching website, but noticed that the GPS costs $100-$1000...not cheap!  I may wait until the spring (when the snow has melted) to investigate this further.
