message: "How nifty! \r\n\r\nI'm considering to implement my own Cheerlight using
  a BlinkM and some other bits and bobs i haven't really identified yet. Perhaps an
  Arduino nano + an Ethernet module, or perhaps a TP-Link TP-WR703n with an Arduino.
  Or something. Having been bitten by the MQTT bug, i too thought MQTT would be the
  perfect transport protocol.\r\n\r\nI don't suppose you would allow worldwide read
  (subscribe) access to your MQTT server? On the other hand, maybe it would be a good
  excercise for me to set up a Node.js server on my other Pi. If it runs on such minimal
  hardware."
