  Hey Cous'
  You've got me curious about Massive Attack and I've heard them mentioned on TV too, but haven't heard any of their music.  What category would they fall under, if I look for them at a CD store?  (I hate to show my ignorance by asking a salesclerk.)

  As for the Ipod...I'll probably buy one when it's gone out of style!

  I'm not sure what eprops are...but I'm guessing they are sort of like gold stars rewarded to the writer.  In any event, I've noticed that the general rule of thumb is to hand out 2 eprops unless you're commenting on your own site, then it's 0 eprops.
