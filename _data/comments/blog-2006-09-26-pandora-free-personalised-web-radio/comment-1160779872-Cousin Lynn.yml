  Hey Cous',
  Pandora sounds so cool.  What will they think of next.

  You have really opened up my mind to some interesting new music and I must check out your Trip Hop Lounge station soon.

  Tell Julie that I have now listened to her favourite Goldfrapp CD and I like it...it's good dance music.  As for Kaiser Chiefs (or Handkerchiefs as Reiss calls them), I play that CD over and over and over in my car on my way home from work.  It makes me smile every time, so I can see why Reiss enjoys this CD.
