<p>I installed Ubuntu Server because I wanted a minimal install befitting a server.  No OpenOffice, games or any other stuff. I know my way around a unix command line but it's just so much quicker to get things done in Windows. Now I think I'd like a light weight GUI on my server that I can start just when I need it. So I need X, Gnome, no login manager and Synaptic for package management.<br />
I'm hoping this should work... Need to look at what's included in gnome-core.</p>
<p><code>$ sudo aptitude install xorg gnome-core </code><tt>synaptic</tt></p>
<p><code>$ startx</code><code></code></p>
