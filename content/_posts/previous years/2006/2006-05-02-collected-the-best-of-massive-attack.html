    Hey Cous'
    You've got me curious about Massive Attack and I've heard them mentioned on TV too, but haven't heard any of their music.  What category would they fall under, if I look for them at a CD store?  (I hate to show my ignorance by asking a salesclerk.)

    As for the Ipod...I'll probably buy one when it's gone out of style!

    I'm not sure what eprops are...but I'm guessing they are sort of like gold stars rewarded to the writer.  In any event, I've noticed that the general rule of thumb is to hand out 2 eprops unless you're commenting on your own site, then it's 0 eprops.

I'm rubbish at describing music but I will say that it's very electronic, often with very moody atmospheric vocals and some times just a little bit dancy - I think the young people call it "trip hop". Basically if I had any musical talent at all, this is the kind of music I would want to make.</p>

So if I have all their albums why did I buy this ? Well I was in an airport again on my way to the USA and just had to have something to listen to in my hire car (which by the way was a new convertible Mustang). If you haven't heard Massive Attack before then this <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000E5L8D4/qid=1146524039/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_11_1/203-7714283-6425569" target="_blank">"greatest hits" collection</a> is a great introduction to the band. If you like this then make sure you also check out <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=music&amp;field-artist=UNKLE/203-7714283-6425569" target="_blank">U.N.K.L.E</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001E7V/qid=1146525426/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/203-7714283-6425569" target="_blank">Tricky's Maxinque</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=music&amp;field-artist=Portishead/203-7714283-6425569" target="_blank">Portishead </a>and maybe some <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007YH67Y/qid=1146525489/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/203-7714283-6425569" target="_blank">Faithless </a>too.</p>
