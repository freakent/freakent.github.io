With their great synth pop they sounded just like they had fallen out of the 80's - absolutley fantastic. Although the whole album is great, there are three tracks that really stand out; Ooh La La, Ride A White Horse and my favourite, Number 1. I'm looking forward to checking out their 2 earlier CDs.</p>
