    Hey Cous',
    I haven't heard of Earthcore or Ancestor.  Sounds like sci-fi reading to me.  I'll wait for the movie(s) and check them out.
    Thanks for your recent comments on my xanga.  I checked out the geocaching website, but noticed that the GPS costs $100-$1000...not cheap!  I may wait until the spring (when the snow has melted) to investigate this further.

    on the movie, could be a few years, so be patient.

I've been batching up a few episodes at a time and listening to them in the car on the way to work. Earthcore was really good, but this story is even more exciting. Great job Scott, can't wait to see the movie :-)</p>
