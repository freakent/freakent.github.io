<blockquote><p> Asterisk is the open source Voice-over-IP solution that everyone's talking about. At OSCON 2005 Scott Mace talked to Brian Capouch, the author of the forthcoming Addison-Wesley book about Asterisk. Capouch discusses why Asterisk is spreading like wildfire, has hooks for video and presence extensions and why Skype is "evil incarnate." VoIP is a disruptive technology and can be integrated with other systems such a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to make them more efficient.</p></blockquote>
