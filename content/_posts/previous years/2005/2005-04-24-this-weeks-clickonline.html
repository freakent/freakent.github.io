<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40027000/gif/_40027254_clickonline_hyp203.gif" alt="ClickOnline" class="alignright" width="200"/></a>In case you haven't seen it, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/">ClickOnline</a> is the BBC's Internet technology show which shown is on BBC News 24 in the middle of the night - thank heavens for Tivo. They also show it on BBC2 on a Sunday morning but this is a shortened version. The show usually features a couple of interesting articles and reviews of some viewer recommended web sites.<br />

On last weeks show they did a piece on Internet security. They put a Windows XP machine on the Internet through a dial-up connection that had no anti-virus and no firewall software. The machine was compromised in 8 seconds !</p>
<p>In this weeks show they answered a viewers question, asking what software was used to detect to the security breach. The actual software used was called <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml">Process Explorer</a>, but they recommended another piece of software called <a href="http://www.what-process.com/">What Process</a> because it was probably easier to use. If you find something suspicious I'd suggest you take a look at <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/">Ad-Aware</a> or the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=321cd7a2-6a57-4c57-a8bd-dbf62eda9671&displaylang=en">Microsoft Anti Spyware</a>, both of which are free to download and use.</p>
<p>Another interesting web site featured this week was <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/">Icon Archive</a>.  It's a useful library of icons for use on your PC or web site.</p>
<p>I have found a few useful things on ClickOnline. Probably the best is a site called <a href="http://www.watchthatpage.com/">WatchThatPage</a>. Basically you register some URLs and WatchThatPage tells you when those web pages change. You get an email saying what has changed and a short summary of the actual changes. It saves having to check web sites regularly for changes.  I have it checking the software download page for my router so that I can see when the new firmware becomes available.</p>
