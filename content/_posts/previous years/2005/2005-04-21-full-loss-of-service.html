<p><img src="http://www.plus.net/image-rotator.php?fmt=j" alt="PlusNet" class="alignright" />My ISP, <a href="http://usertools.plus.net/status/archive/1113846316.htm">Plusnet</a>, has let me and a good many other customers down badly. The server they provide for us to host dynamic web sites, and the server that hosts this blog, suffered a complete hard disk failure during routine maintenace and <strong>ALL data was lost</strong>. My whole Gadget Zone blog is lost. I suppose I should have kept a back up on my own PC, but that's easy to say now.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
I just found an old back up of my blog text from the end of february. So it's just the March and April posts which are missing now.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Since I needed to rebuild my site completely I thought this might be a good opportunity to see what other Blog software is available. Thanks to a bit of googling I found <a href="http://www.asymptomatic.net/blogbreakdown.htm">this review</a> on the web, the clear winner was a piece of software called WordPress. I decided to give it a go and so far I'm quite impressed. WordPress looks like it can do a lot more than the version of MoveableType I was using before. It looks like I can actually host my whole web site in WordPress, not just this blog. So I think it's time for a new start - new URL, new site, new everything.</p>
