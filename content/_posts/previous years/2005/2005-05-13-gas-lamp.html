<p><a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail514.html"><img src="http://www.itconversations.com/assets/gifs/itcLogo.gif" alt="IT Conversations" align="right" width="200" /></a>This is an interesting Podcast on IT Conversations about how the combination of Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP/Perl/Python (a.k.a. "LAMP") has become the mostly used web application platform. Despite being one of the biggest supporters of Java and J2EE from the start, I have long been pointing out that most of the web seems to be still running on CGI. Actually come to think of it, this blog is powered by LAMP. Peter Yared interviewed here is from a company that has put together an "Enterprise Grid" enable LAMP product. He reveals a few interesting facts about web application servers - I especially liked the bit about heterogeneous two phased commit.<br />
