<p><a href="http://www.systm.org/"><img class="alignright" src="http://revision3.com/systm/showlogo.gif" alt="Systm" width="200" /></a>I first heard about this new Internet-TV show on the "<a href="http://www.thisweekintech.com/">This Week In Tech (TWiT)</a>" Podcast. Kevin Rose, one of the presenters of Systm is a regular guest on TwiT. Systm just released their 2nd episode. This episode is all about building a Linux based MythTV PVR. They go into quite a lot of detail and explain stuff quite well. The first episode showed how to build a box of tricks that would pick up wireless video cameras. This show is very cool and is very professionally produced despite being <strong>free</strong> to download.  You will need a <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/introduction.html">Bittorrent</a> client to download the show, I'd recommend <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a>. If you like <a href="http://www.systm.org">Systm</a> you should also check out <a href="http://fromtheshadows.tv/">From The Shadows</a>.</p>
