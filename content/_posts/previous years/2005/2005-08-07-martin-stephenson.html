<p><a href="http://www.daintees.com"><img src="http://wfmu.org/Playlists/BM/10-11-08/MartinStephenson.JPG" alt="Martin Stephenson" class="alignright"/></a>This weekend I unpacked my turntable and dug out a number of my records. My <a href="http://www.linn.co.uk">Linn</a> really is a thing of beauty! I have hooked up a PC  to my amp and have been digitising a few records that I can't get on CD any more.  (In case you are interested how, check out the <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=recording&i=records-tapes">Audacity</a> web site.) Amongst my great records, I have re-discovered my Martin Stephenson & The Daintees albums, Boat To Bolivia and Gladsome, Humour & Blue. Absolutely fantastic. It's not quite the sort of stuff you'd expect me to be into, no electro kick drums or Trip-hop bass synths, just great songs and great musicians playing real instruments.  I did a quick Google and found that Martin Stephenson is still going and has his own <a href="http://www.daintees.com">web site</a>. Looks like there are some newer CD's I should listen to. I see he is still playing live too, I'd love to see them live again. Any way, check out their music and the web site.</p>
