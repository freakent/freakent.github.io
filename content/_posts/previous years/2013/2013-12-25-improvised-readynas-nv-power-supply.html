    in the short term. \r\n\r\nI'm gonna order a replacement power supply from Overtek
    that has a cooling fan! and rerouted cooling so I can stuff my NAS back in its
    old place without having bits hanging everywhere.\r\n\r\ntop stuff"

    What kind of power supply did you use? Wattage?\r\n- Which pins did you switch
    / remove?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  content: "Taking a long shot that comments are still checked here - would you be
    able to describe more specifically how you rearraged the wiring? For someone not
    electronically inclined, the instructions that \"-12v Blue and -5V White need
    to be changed to 12V Yellow\" doesn't give me enough instruction :)\r\n\r\nMuch
    appreciated"

<p><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.chriserice.com/word/uploads/20060210-readynasnv-003.jpg" width="200" />The power supply on my Infrant/Netgear <a href="http://www.readynas.com/">ReadyNAS NV</a> has died again. That's the third power supply in just over 7 years that has failed.</p>
<p>The ReadyNAS has mostly been great but the power supply really has been it's achilles heal. The RAID set up means that if a disk fails you can still get at your data and can simply swap out the failed disk for a new one. But when the power supply fails you are screwed. You can't get at your data and, since they use a proprietary wiring scheme, you can't just pop into you local PC store to buy a new one. Netgear will sell you a replacement, but they are really overpriced and it can take several days for shipping, assuming they even have them in stock.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to this <a href="http://www.readynas.com/download/archive/pdf/ReadyNAS_PSU_pinout.pdf" target="_blank">ReadyNAS PSU pinout</a>&nbsp;document I found on Netgear's ReadyNAS site, I figured out how to re-wire a standard ATX power supply to work with the ReadyNAS. I pulled a power supply out of an old PC and swapped a couple of wires around. The result isn't pretty but it works.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.freakent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_0898.jpg"><img class="wp-image-852 aligncenter" alt="IMG_0898" src="http://www.freakent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_0898.jpg" width="480" height="359" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The hardest bit was actually pulling out the two molex pins without destroying the molex. This video came in very handy.</span><br />
