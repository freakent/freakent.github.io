<p><a href="http://www.scottsigler.net/earthcore/"><img src="http://www.scottsigler.net/images/earthcorecover.jpg" alt="EarthCore Cover" class="alignright" width="100"/></a>I've discovered a new Podcast called EarthCore. It's not like all the amateur radio shows, it's a talking book distributed a chapter or two at a time as a Podcast. The story is a kind of sci-fi horror with plenty of people comming to not so pleasent ends. It  is read by the author Scott Sigler and he makes a great job of bringing the characters to life.  Check it out, I can't wait until the next episode.</p>
