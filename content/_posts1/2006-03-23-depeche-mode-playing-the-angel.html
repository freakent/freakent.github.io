In recent years it has felt to me like they have been going off the rails a bit, but this new album is brilliant. It's the CD that is constantly played in the car now. Reiss' favourite track (and mine) is John The Revelator, he just keeps playing it over and over again - I'm scared I might end up getting sick of it !</p>
