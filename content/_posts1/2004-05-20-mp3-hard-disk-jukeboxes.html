  content: And then the iPod came along and everything changed. It's funny to see
    that the iPod doesn't actually match up to the high requirements I originally
    set.

<p>I was interested to read that <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk">PC Pro magazine </a>has this month published a review of the top 18 portable MP3 players. The market leader is by far the Apple iPod so it was a surprise to see the iPod not even making the top 5. Although the iPod generally scores well on looks, style and ease of use, it falls down on price and battery life. Some of the other models now available have a battery life that is around 2 - 3 times as long and cost considerably less. This is in addition to the scare stories that appeared recently about the iPod</p>
