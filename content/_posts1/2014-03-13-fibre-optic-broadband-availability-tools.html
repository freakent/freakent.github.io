<p>So what do you do if the BT's Broadband availability checker says that your exchange has been enabled for FTTC (Fibre to the cabinet), but your broadband provider says it is not available at your address? Dig a little deeper and look at whether you are connected directly to the exchange of via a cabinet.</p>

<p>Only trouble is I still can't figure out how to find out when my local cabinet will be upgraded.</p>
<p>This looks like a useful troubleshooting tip.</p>
