<p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"><img class="alignright" title="Rails" src="http://rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png" alt="" width="87" height="111" /></a>I have a number of Ruby-on-Rails apps on my little Ubuntu server, each one accessible using a sub URI. For example, the home controller of the homework application is accessed with:</p>
<pre>http://bravo.local/homework/home</pre>
<p>Where <em>homework</em> is the sub URI configured to serve my application and <em>home</em> is the name of one of the controllers. The Apache/Passenger configuration for this set up is documented <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#deploying_rack_to_sub_uri">here</a>.</p>
<p><!--more-->This approach has worked fine until I used the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> gem in my latest Rails app. I discovered that the attachment links that were being generated started with a slash but did not include the application's sub URI. To work around this issue I needed some way to append the relevant sub uri to the Paperclip URI. I hate hard coding stuff like this and I wanted something that would work in different environments. I added a</p>
<pre><%= debug request.inspect %></pre>
<p>to one of my views and found that there is a method <strong><em>request#script_name</em></strong> that returns the complete protocol, port, host name and the sub URI. Problem solved! Not quite. I like to keep my views nice and tidy so I construct that URL in a helper. In fact, after watching <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/286-draper">Ryan Bates' Rails Casts</a>, I have become a big fan of the decorator gem <a href="https://github.com/jcasimir/draper">Draper</a>. Thanks to an email from Jeff Casimir, the author of Draper, I learned that I could access the request object directly from the Draper helper method. Here's an example:</p>
<pre>  def link
    # doc.doc is the Paperclip object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url = h.request.script_name + doc.doc.url&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.link_to doc.description, url
  end</pre>
