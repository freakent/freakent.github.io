    Hey Cous',
    It seems that Earthcore is not easy to find in bookstores.  But I'm still searching and will let you know once I track it down.  I may check the local library next.

    The best place to get Scott's books is at Dragon Moon Press (http://www.dragonmoonpress.com/). I bought my Dad a copy from them for Christmas.

<p><a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/"><img src="http://www.scottsigler.com/files/images/INFECTED%20COVER-small.jpg" width="150" alt="Infected" class="alignright"/></a>My favourite podcast author, <a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/">Scott Sigler</a>, just released his third podcast novel called <del datetime="2009-08-06T00:38:29+00:00">Infection</del> Infected. His previous novels, <a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/earthcore.html">Earthcore</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/ancestor">Ancestor</a>, had me on the edge of my (car) seat so I have high hopes for this story too. I am now on a mission to get as many people as possible to experience Scott's work as possible - so if you are reading my blog, I insist you go to <a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/">http://www.scottsigler.com/</a> now and start listening!</p>
<p>---update---<br />
Scott's novel "Infection" was renamed "Infected" shortly after it was first podcast.</p>
